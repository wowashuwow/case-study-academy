## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

If you're a web dev agency that hasn't tried case studies yet but is curious about them, this course is for you. I'll help you answer questions like:

1. Should *we* invest in case studies?
2. How do we get client approval? And what do we need to produce a case study?
3. How to write a good case study?
4. How to use case studies in the sales process?
