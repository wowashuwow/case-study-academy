# Tips for writers

## Finding information

You'll find the pain points in your sales call recordings/notes, in the RFP, and in the project SoW (Scope of Work) document. 

In the solution section, you describe how you helped the client solve their problem. Rather than listing everything you did for the client

## Sell your approach before you sell your offer

Make the case for your *approach* - explain to your potential client why you believe it's the right approach for them, what makes it different from other things they've tried, how it's going to solve their problems - *then* talk about why they should pick you over the others.

Customers need to be sold on your approach (WordPress) before they can be sold on working with you.

## Be careful of what you say

Don't say anything that makes the client look bad. For example, if they were on a really old version of WordPress, like say 1.0, that's no longer supported, don't mentioning that detail in the case study. Just say "an older version of WordPress," that's it. Be diplomatic. Tread lightly.

## Think like *you're* the potential client

Think about how the story would resonate with people at companies facing similar problems. They want to see themselves in the story. You want to convey to them that you really understand their problems. Put yourself in their shoes and think about what you'd like to see, then write it.
