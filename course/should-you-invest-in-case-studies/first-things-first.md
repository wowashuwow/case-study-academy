# "The cobblerâ€™s children have no shoes."

I see many agencies fall into this trap - amazing client work, but a neglected website of their own.

Your website is often the first impression potential clients have of you. It's an opportunity to show who you are, what you care about, and how much you care. 

Take it.

If your website is broken in any way - performance, design, copy, UX, or anything else - fix it yesterday. 

Don't let your website:
- Limit your potential in the kind of clients and projects you can attract and win 
- Unnecessarily lengthen your sales cycle because your prospects simply can't be confident about you
- Hurt your negotiation power during sales

Look, I get it. I understand your challenge: "It's not the right time to fix the website. There's too much client work."

The right time will never come. Client work will never end, and that annoying CLS on your homepage that's been bothering you (and your potential clients (of course they notice it too!)) will keep getting pushed unless you decide to fix it now. 

You don't need a lot to make a good first impression.

An error-free website with good design and good copy that fit together well to convey your marketing message is enough.

Any marketing budget you've got, before you spend it on case studies (or anything else), spend it on getting your website in tip-top shape.

Now let's move on.
