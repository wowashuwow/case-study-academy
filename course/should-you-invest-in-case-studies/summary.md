# Summary

Case studies help you shorten your sales cycle and get new leads. But, depending on your current situation, you may want to focus your time and effort elsewhere before you think about case studies.

1. First of all, make sure your own website isn't sabotaging your efforts.
2. If you're struggling to close existing leads from your network, case studies will help you close more and close faster.
3. If your website gets decent traffic, case studies will help you convert visitors into leads before they bounce.
4. If network leads and/or traffic are low, you need to talk to more people and work on getting eyeballs on your website first.
5. If you have well-developed network-lead-sources but you want more work, consider pairing case studies with content marketing to tap into the market outside your network.
6. If multiple lead channels are already working well for you and there's no dearth of work, case studies can still help you shorten your sales cycle and get new leads, but you'll need to do a cost-benefit analysis to find out if it's financially worth it.
