# Always be thinking about the case study

Collect material for the case study *while* you’re doing the project. 

This way the case study will not feel like a burden later. It'll also be much more efficient to create. Developing processes may take some time, but it’s worth it. Focus long-term.

Notes from pre-sales calls and discussions to define the scope of work will tell you the pain points and help you write the initial part of the story. Make a note of the before-after CWV scores, take screenshots of the old CMS interface if it's a migration project. Ask the client for other data that's not readily available (for eg. the amount they were paying in licensing costs on their previous CMS).

Of course, each project is different, but if you have standard types of projects you do, keep developing the SOPs for each.
